_NOTE: Due to the size of the data file, you will need `git-lfs` installed to clone this repository. You can install the tool via homebrew and other package managers, or you can download the library. For more details, see Github's https://git-lfs.github.com/[page^] for information on git-lfs._

The data is borrowed from my colleague's https://github.com/moxious/meetup-dataset[Github repository^]. Only the city, country, and region data is used from that repository (with some minor syntax tweaks and changes).
