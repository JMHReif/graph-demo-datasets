= Example Queries

A few queries to explore the data and show how same data could be used for beneficial or harmful uses.

== Scenario #1 - credit card fraudulent charges

=== Good:
* uses patterns, location, amounts, etc to catch unusual transactions
* identify potential fraud quickly
* reduces financial burdens for customer and credit card company

[source,cypher]
----
//Find last true transaction with staff who took order
MATCH (c:Customer)-[rel]-(o:Order)-[rel2]-(p:Product)
RETURN o.transactionId, o.orderDate, o.orderTime, o.staffId
ORDER BY o.orderDate DESC
LIMIT 5;
----

=== Bad:
* can track habits / schedules and changes (is store close to home or to grocery store?)
* demographic and/or location data for categorizing likes/trends/habits
* make assumptions about or influence lifestyle, wants, and needs

[source,cypher]
----
//Find customer generation with order dates and times
MATCH (c:Customer)-[rel]-(o:Order)-[rel2]-(p:Product)
OPTIONAL MATCH (c)-[r3:BORN_IN]-(b:BirthYear)-[r4:FALLs_IN]-(g:Generation)
RETURN c.customerId, g.name, o.orderDate, o.orderTime
ORDER BY o.orderDate DESC, o.orderTime DESC
LIMIT 5;
----

[source,cypher]
----
//Find locations of stores visited and when (long/lat on Store)
MATCH (c:Customer)-[rel]-(o:Order)-[rel2]-(s:Store)-[rel3]-(other)
OPTIONAL MATCH (c)-[rel4:LIVES_IN]->(c2:City)
RETURN * LIMIT 50;
----

== Scenario #2 - providing products customers need

=== Good:
* ensure inventory and shelving is optimized for customer favorites
* check rules and habits before potentially recommending something sensitive/offensive

[source,cypher]
----
//Ensure inventory for customerâ€™s commonly ordered products
MATCH (c:Customer)-[rel]-(o:Order)-[rel2]-(gp:GroceryProduct)-[rel3]-(gc:GroceryCategory)
RETURN gp.productName, count(o) as timesOrdered
ORDER BY timesOrdered DESC LIMIT 10;
----

[source,cypher]
----
//Check dietary restrictions for product recommendations (could look for products in categories that are true/false for common allergens)
MATCH (c:Customer)-[rel]-(o:Order)-[rel2]-(gp:GroceryProduct)-[rel3]-(gc:GroceryCategory)
RETURN gp.productName, gp.containsAllergens, gc.category, count(o) as timesOrdered
ORDER BY timesOrdered DESC LIMIT 10;
----

=== Bad:
* make assumptions about age, lifestage, needs (medical or otherwise) that are private
* alter pricing or margins on products that are purchase staples, knowing customers will not sacrifice certain things
* targeting customer demographics, influencing purchases

=== Good
* accurate recommendations based on genre, ageCertification, and similar titles
* notify releases of new episodes in shows customer has watched
* calculate similarity to other customers for cross-selling, recommending, and appropriate marketing

[source,cypher]
----
//Find customer preferences across genres, ageCerts, and titles
MATCH (c:Customer)-[r:WATCHED]->(t:Title)-[r2]->(g:Genre)
RETURN c.customerId, g.genre, t.ageCertification, collect(t.title)
ORDER BY g.genre;
----

=== Bad
* deduce whether children are in the household (in residence or home daycare)
* track when certain films or genres are watched (late nights, during day)
* connecting generational/demographic data and targeting based on those

[source,cypher]
----
//Check how much content is child-friendly
MATCH (c:Customer)-[r:WATCHED]->(t:Title)-[r2]->(g:Genre)
WHERE g.genre = "Family"
OR t.ageCertification IN ["TV-G","TV-Y7","TV-PG","G","PG"]
RETURN t.ageCertification, count(DISTINCT t.title) as count, collect(DISTINCT g.genre)
ORDER BY count DESC;
