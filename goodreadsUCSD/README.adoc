= Goodreads UCSD

This data is sourced from the https://mengtingwan.github.io/data/goodreads.html[UCSD Book Graph project^], which contains JSON files of data from Goodreads with books, authors, reviews, users, and more.

The files included in this repository are subsets of the UCSD full version of the data that the owner of this repository tailored to this particular demo. However, the whole data set may be used or referenced at some point in the future.

== Data Model

image:{img}/goodreads-data-model.png[]

There are currently a few different sizes/renditions of data sets available in this repository:

* `10k-books` - a subset of the full data set with 10,000 books
* `50k-books-ai` - a subset of the full data set with 50,000 books, includes code to generate embeddings
* `ai-embeddings` - the 10,000 books set with additional data for loading embeddings for use in AI applications
* _(Coming soon!)_ `full` - the full data set with all 2.3 million books

== AI Embeddings folder

There is a separate folder with slightly altered data load script and a Python embedding generator script.

* The load script in the `ai-embeddings` folder accommodates property and index name requirements for https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/vectordbs/neo4j.html[Spring AI with Neo4j^] - properties need to be named `id` and `text`, and the index name has to be `spring-ai-document-index`.
* The `generate-embeddings.py` script is a Python script that pulls the text of book reviews from Neo4j, calls the https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings?lang=python[OpenAI API^] to generate embeddings, and then stores the embeddings back in Neo4j. To run this script, you will need to have an OpenAI API key and set it to the `openai_key` variable in the script, as well as credentials for a Neo4j database (such as an https://dev.neo4j.com/aura-java[Aura free-tier instance^]).
